## What is a Blue Team?

 - A [blue team](https://purplesec.us/red-team-vs-blue-team-cyber-security/#Blue) consists of security professionals who have an inside out view of the organization. Their task is to protect the organization’s critical assets against any kind of threat.

 
- They are well aware of the business objectives and the organization’s security strategy. Therefore, their task is to strengthen the castle walls so no intruder can compromise the defenses.
